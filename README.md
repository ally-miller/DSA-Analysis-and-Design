# DSA-Analysis-and-Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

   The problem I was solving in the projects for this course is that it was difficult for ABC University's advisors to access course information for students in the Computer Science degree program. ABCU was looking for software to make it easier for their advisors to access this information so they could enroll students in the classes they needed. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    
    My first step in approaching this problem was to understand the needs of the program. I created pseudocode to implement this program using a vector, hashtable, and binary tree data structure. I then performed a run-time evaulation to determine the best data structure to use for this project, and based on the Big O analysis, I chose to do it using hashtables. Understanding data structures is important for several reasons. Properly chosen data structures can increase efficency of the program and help with scaling in the future as more students enroll in ABCU. Furthermore, clear and well-organized data structures can help keep the program easier to understand and maintain. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    
    The biggest roadblock I encountered was writing the pseudocode. I found it difficult to think in terms of what to do without writing code, and I was a little too technical in my pseudocode. I mostly referred to our textbook and some of the provided resources in our class to try to understand how to write better pseudocode. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    
    I feel more confident in my ability to understand which type of data structure to use based on the run-time evaulation I performed. I feel going forward I will be able to use this to help me decide in the future what data structures to implement in future work. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    My work on this project has evolved the way that I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adopting and sticking to consistent coding conventions and understanding how important data structures are and how or when to use them. I also made sure that my code was modular, so each function served functionality. That way, changes can be made with ease.
